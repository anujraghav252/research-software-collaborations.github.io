project_title: Advancing BinnedDistributionFit.jl for HEP Analysis
project_goal: >
  High Energy Physics (HEP) analyses heavily rely on binned likelihood fits. This project proposes
  to significantly develop and mature BinnedDistributionFit.jl, with the following goals:
  (1) Integrating the popular optimizer in HEP, Minuit2.jl, with the Optimization.jl interface.
  (2) Expanding the available likelihood functions (e.g., binned Chi-squared) and model types to
  cover basics from RooFit, such as ExtendPdf and SumPdf
  (3) JuliaHEP ecosystem integration such as supporting building likelihood from FHist.jl
  (4) Establishing comprehensive documentation and testing.
  In the JuliaHEP fitting ecosystem, this package will complement the unbinned fit focused AlgebraPDF.jl.
