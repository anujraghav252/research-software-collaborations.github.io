project_title: Adopting CppInterOp in Cppyy
project_goal: >
  cppyy is a Python library that provides fully automatic, dynamic Python-C++ bindings using the
  cling based C++ interpreter/incremental compiler. Cling itself is based on the LLVM toolchain.
  Compiler Research maintains its own fork of cppyy. The main motivation of this fork is to directly
  use the LLVMâ€™s clang-REPL as C/C++ interpreter/incremental compiler and runtime reflection
  library. This reduces the burden on the developers to maintain a separate fork of LLVM like the
  cling interpreter. The main goal of this project is to complete this migration from using cling
  as the interpreter backend to using clang-REPL through CppInterOp. CppInterOp is developed and
  maintained by compiler research. It is a high level abstraction of the underlying LLVM API.
  CppInterOp is designed to be simple and minimalistic. It is built for the
  purpose of language interoperability, incremental C++ compilation, and runtime C++ reflection.
