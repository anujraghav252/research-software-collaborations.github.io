project_title: "Trigger Efficiency Determination in CMS B-Physics Parked Data"
project_goal: >
      For Run-3, B-parking trigger has larger bandwidth to provide expanded physics potential for the CMS experiment. The strategy developed by us will be useful for analysis of B-parking data collected in Run-3.
