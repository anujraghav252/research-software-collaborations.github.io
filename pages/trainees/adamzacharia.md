project_title: Correlation Function Analysis
project_goal: >
  The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a versatile software layer that can effectively
  perform fits and solve system of equations. By building upon existing frameworks in lattice QCD, this
  software layer will enable researchers to extract multiple form-factors with ease and efficiency.
