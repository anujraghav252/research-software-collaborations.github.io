project_title: Particle Identification with CMS Data using ML

project_goal: >
  This project focuses on electron identification in the Forward Hadron Calorimeter (HF) of the CMS detector,By incorporating HF coverage into electron detection, physics measurements can leverage a broader spectrum of accepted electrons, potentially offering new insights into particle interactions.
