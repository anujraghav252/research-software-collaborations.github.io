project_title: Anomaly Detection using XLSTM-VAE for Data Quality Monitoring in Liquid Argon Calorimeters
project_goal: >
  ● A fully documented XLSTM-VAE model integrated with the IRIS-HEP anomaly detection infrastructure.
  ● Complete source code for training, evaluation, and inference to ensure the work can be reproduced and built upon.
  ● A trained XLSTM-VAE model capable of capturing longer temporal dependencies, leading to better anomaly detection in the detector data.
  ● Performance comparisons showing how this model stands against traditional LSTM-VAE models, especially in handling data drift over time.
  ● A comprehensive technical report detailing the methods, implementation, experiments, and results, ready for publication on platforms like arXiv or Zenodo.
