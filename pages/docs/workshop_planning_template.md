# Template for Workshop Planning

Here are some general notes and questions to help guide the iterative
discussions required to organize a workshop.

## 1) Workshop Dates
  * What are the planned workshop dates? 
  * How many full days? Any half days?
  * Are there any issues with local or national holidays?

## 2) Funding
  * What the HSF-India project can support
  * Options for local event support and local participant support

## 2) Timeline for registrations/selections, etc.
  * When will we open and close registration?
  * By when will we communicate selection for the event?
  * Are there any deadlines for local funding proposals? 
  * Are there deadlines for organizing visas (letters, etc.) for people?

## 4) Organizing for visas for people that need them (list of external participants)

## 5) Lecture room considerations
  * size and layout of lecture room given expected number of participants
  * important considerations:
    * WiFi (with sufficient bandwidth and scalability for number participants)
    * access to power for all individual's laptops
    * tables or fold out/up tablet desks in lecture hall seats
    * size, brightness, visibility and resolution of the main screen 
      * we will be showing code which is often dense text with a smaller font
    * audio 

## 6) Organization for breaks/lunches and a social dinner

## 7) Accommodations for participants
  * Hotel options
  * guest house or student accommodations

## 8) Poster and advertising
  * Poster for the website and/or signage during the event
  * Where do we advertise
