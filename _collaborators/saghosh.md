### Biography

Saranya Ghosh is an experimental high energy physicist at the Indian
Institute of Technology Hyderabad, India. His research interest lie is
the area of search for new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM)
particularly focusing on unconventional signatures including soft and
long lived particles that align with the predictions from various
different BSM models that seek to address the Dark Matter puzzle along
with other shortcomings of the Standard Model, Higgs physics based -
particularly measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson and the
search for additional Higgs like particles, and precision measurements
of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics.Â  His research interests
also extend to particle detector R&D and particle reconstruction &
simulation at detectors. His main experiment of focus is the Compact
Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment based at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),
he has been working on the CMS experiment since 2011, he is also
involved in studies for the Future Circular Collider and the muon
g-2/EDM experiment at JPARC.

### Project interests
