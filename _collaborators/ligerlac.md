### Biography

Lino Gerlach is a postdoctoral researcher in the Institute for Computational Science and Engineering at Princeton University. He earned a Ph.D. in High Energy Physics in 2021 from the University of GÃ¶ttingen, where he was a member of the ATLAS experiment at CERN. Following his doctorate, he held a software-focused postdoctoral position with the DUNE experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory. His current research is centered on the CMS experiment at CERN, with a focus on ultra-low-latency anomaly detection for the trigger system and on differentiable computing techniques aimed at enabling end-to-end optimization in high-energy physics workflows. In addition to his research, he is passionate about global scientific collaboration and education, particularly in mentoring aspiring scientists in the field of machine learning for scientific applications.
