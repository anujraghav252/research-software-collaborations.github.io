### Biography
Dr. Bhawna Gomber is an experimental particle physicist whose area of expertise is search for beyond standard model physics like dark matter, large extra dimensions, anomalous trilinear gauge coupling, SUSY and developing firmware for calorimeter Level-1 trigger using the proton-proton collision data of the LHC. His current research focuses on the [Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment](https://cms.cern) at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.web.cern.ch/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) at the [European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN)](http://home.web.cern.ch/). 

### Project interests
Her research group at Hyderabad is involved in dark matter search analysis in different mono-X searches using the CMS experiment at LHC.
The group is also involved in firmware development for the calorimeter Level-1 trigger algorithm in collaboration with University of Wisconsin-Madison group. The group is also coordinating the Strategy for Trigger Evaluation And Monitoring in Trigger Studies group at CMS, LHC.
