### Biography

Varun Sharma is a research scientist in the Department of Physics at the
University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. He has been an active member of the
Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
since 2011. Sharma earned his Ph.D. from the Department of Physics &
Astrophysics at the University of Delhi, India, focusing on the
substructure of quarks.

His current research explores physics beyond the Standard Model,
particularly dark matter searches and its potential links to the Higgs
sector. He also investigates lepton-flavor violating decays of the Higgs
boson. Sharma serves as the co-convener of the Hadronic/Photon subgroup
within the "Searches for New Physics in Final States with Unbalanced
Transverse Momentum and Standard Objects (SUS)" Physics Analysis group in
the CMS experiment.

Sharma has contributed extensively to the CMS trigger system, serving as
the trigger technical coordinator from 2019 to 2022. During this period, he
ensured efficient operation of the CMS calorimeter trigger system and
contributed significant algorithm upgrades for future improvements. His
work involved using the Xilinx Vivado High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tool to
develop firmware and demonstrate its performance on prototype boards. In
2022, he received the CMS Achievement Award for his outstanding
coordination and exceptional commitment to the Level-1 Trigger system's
operations.
