### Biography
  I am a Scientific Officer at the Variable Energy Cyclotron Center, where I have been employed since 2004, as well as a collaborator on the ALICE Experiment at CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland, and the CBM experiment at FAIR at GSI in Darmstadt, Germany. I have a Master of Technology in Computer Science from IIT Kanpur and a PhD in Engineering under aegis of Homi Bhabha National Institute.

### Project interests
  I am managing the Grid Computing Facility, VECC and Deputy Coordinator for the regional WLCG India project. I am looking after all aspects of Grid Facility like cluster building, GRID middleware and High Energy Physics related software configurations, infrastructure management, petabyte storage configurations, hardware and network management etc. 

I am also involved in trigger implementation for the Muon Chamber (MuCh) at CBM experiment and evaluating many-core / GPU architecture feasibility for the the real time event selection process.
