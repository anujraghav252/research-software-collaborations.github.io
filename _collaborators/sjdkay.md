### Biography

Stephen Kay is a research associate at the University of York in the United Kingdom. Stephen earned his PhD in Physics at the University of Edinburgh in 2018. Stephen was then a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Regina, SK, Canada, until May 2023. Whilst at Regina, Stephen devoted a lot of his time to the Pion and Kaon LT experiments in [Jefferson Lab Hall C](https://www.jlab.org/physics/hall-c). These experiments acquired data from 2018 to 2022. As the project developed, Stephen became increasingly involved in projects related to the [Electron-Ion Collider, EIC](https://www.bnl.gov/eic/). These projects and an increased focus on the EIC continued into Stephen's current role at the University of York. Now, Stephen co-convenes the [ePIC](https://www.bnl.gov/eic/epic.php) user learning working group and is Detector Subsystem Technical Coordinator for the Far-Backward Pair Spectrometer. This is one of the key luminosity monitoring detector systems for ePIC. Stephen also investigates the feasibility of future meson structure studies at the EIC using ePIC and is heavily involved in the Exclusive, Diffraction and Tagging physics working group for ePIC.

### Project interests

Stephen's current interests and topics cover a range of interests at the EIC, including:
* Light meson structure
* ePIC Software Development
* User learning and training for ePIC software
* Luminosity monitoring systems
* ePIC Far-Forward and Far-Backward detector subsystems
