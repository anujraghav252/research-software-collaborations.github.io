### Biography

Michelle Kuchera is an associate professor of physics and computer science, and director of the applied mathematics program at Davidson College, She is interested in deep learning for the analysis of accelerator-based physics data, and is PI of the Algorithms for Learning in Physics Applications (ALPhA) research group. She collaborates extensively with physicists at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams in Michigan, USA, and has broad deep learning interests, but is currently particularly interested in modeling stochastic processes and building pre-trained models that can help physicists analyze data for a variety of tasks.


### Project interests
Michelle is interested in point cloud and sparse tensor deep learning for deep learning applications in time projection chambers. Specific applications include data cleaning, track-wise classification and regression tasks, and track completion tasks.
