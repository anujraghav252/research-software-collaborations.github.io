### Biography

Jim Libby is a Professor of Physics at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. He works on the Belle II and BESIII experiments specializing in the study of quark and lepton flavour physics, as well as low-multiplicity physics related to muon g-2 and the dark sector. He has been using machine learning since his PhD in the 1990s mostly for classification problems and is interested in leveraging these tools further, particularly in the context of precision electron-positron collisions.

### Project interests

Systematically robust machine learning and fitting methods for precision measurements.
